# Flash-Card-Creator
-A Thinkful project assigned to develop skills related to React front end practices.

-This project allows the user to create flash cards to study difficult topics.

-The features include: 
    -The ability to create and delete decks with user generated names.
    -The ability to create and delete cards with user genereated information.
    -Each deck contains a collection of cards with a front and back that can be 
       flipped when the user is ready.
       
-Created usings the following tools/technologies: React, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

-This project dissapated the fog for me on how React compenents work together and how they
   were supposed to be structured.
   
-Future changes will include style changes and an implementation of an entirely new backend.
